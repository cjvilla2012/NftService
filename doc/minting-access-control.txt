1. If mint does not require MINTER role:

- Anyone can call the method
- Said anyone can assign any set of CIDs, valid or not
- Said anyone is charged for the minting
- Therefore said anyone can create a token with bad metadata addresses
- So?

2. If mint DOES require MINTER role:

- Admin must assign MINTER role and this will be charged to the Admin
- MINTER can call the method even outside of True Picture
- At this point consequences are the same as for 1, above.
